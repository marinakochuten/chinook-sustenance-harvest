# Chinook Subsistence Harvest

## About

This repository contains files for my final project for EDS 222 - Statistics for Environmental Data Science. For this project, I use a randomization test to test the hypothesis: "Is the proportion of Chinook salmon harvested greater in the subsistence sector than the commercial sector?"

All of the code for my analysis can be found in `chinook_harvest.qmd`. The data used is the `Harvest_All_Sectors.csv`.

## Data details

The data for this analysis comes from the [State of Alaska People and Salmon Project's (SASAP) data portal](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/portals/SASAP/Data). I am using a file that that counts harvest of the 5 Pacific salmon species across fishing sectors in Alaska from 1995-2016.
